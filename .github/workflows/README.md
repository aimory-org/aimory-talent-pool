# CI/CD Workflows

Every pull request targeting `main` must pass all PR workflows before merge.
Merging to `main` triggers the deploy workflow automatically (subject to environment approval gates).

## Pull Request Workflows

### `pr-lambda-tests.yml` — Lambda Tests
**Triggers:** any PR touching Python source files.

| Step | Tool | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Auto-fix style | `ruff --fix`, `black` | Automatically commits style fixes back to the PR branch so the author doesn't have to |
| Lint | `ruff` | Enforces import order, unused variables, whitespace — fails if anything remains after auto-fix |
| Format check | `black` | Enforces consistent Python formatting |
| Type checking | `mypy` | Static type analysis across all Lambda source directories; catches type errors before runtime |
| SAST | `bandit` | Security linter — flags medium+ severity issues (e.g. hardcoded secrets, shell injection, insecure deserialization). Findings printed in the CI log |
| Dependency CVEs | `pip-audit` | Scans `requirements-dev.txt` and layer `requirements.txt` files against the PyPI advisory database |
| Unit tests | `pytest` + `moto` | Runs all tests in `infra/tests/unit/`. All AWS calls are mocked with moto — no real AWS credentials needed. Coverage report posted as a PR comment |

**Python source directories scanned:**
- `infra/modules/api/lambda_src/`
- `infra/modules/document_pipeline/lambda_src/`
- `infra/modules/jobs/lambda_src/`
- `infra/modules/storage/lambda_src/`
- `infra/pipeline_configs/`

### `pr-frontend-tests.yml` — Frontend Tests
**Triggers:** any PR touching `frontend/web/**`.

| Step | Tool | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Dependency CVEs | `npm audit --audit-level=high` | Fails the PR if any high or critical CVEs are found in `package-lock.json` |
| Auto-fix style | `eslint --fix` | Automatically commits lint fixes back to the PR branch |
| Lint | `eslint` | Enforces code style, React hooks rules, unused imports, etc. |
| Type check (app) | `tsc --noEmit` | TypeScript compilation check for the production bundle |
| Type check (tests) | `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.test.json` | TypeScript compilation check for test files |
| Tests + coverage | `vitest` + `@vitest/coverage-v8` | Runs all component and utility tests; coverage report uploaded as a PR artifact |

---

### `pr-terraform-plan.yml` — Terraform Plan
**Triggers:** any PR touching `infra/**`.

| Step | Tool | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Auto-fix formatting | `terraform fmt` | Automatically commits format fixes back to the PR branch |
| Format check | `terraform fmt -check` | Fails if any `.tf` files are not canonically formatted |
| Init | `terraform init` | Initialises providers and modules |
| Validate | `terraform validate` | Checks configuration syntax and internal consistency |
| IaC lint | `tflint` + AWS ruleset | Checks for deprecated syntax, unused declarations, naming conventions, missing type annotations, and AWS-specific best practices. Configured via `.tflint.hcl` |
| IaC security scan | `checkov` | Scans Terraform resources against 1000+ security and compliance checks. Findings printed in the CI log. Accepted-risk suppressions documented in `.checkov.yaml` |
| Plan | `terraform plan` | Produces a full execution plan; output posted as a PR comment |

---

### `pr-security.yml` — Secret Scanning
**Triggers:** every PR targeting `main`.

| Step | Tool | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Secret scanning | `gitleaks` | Scans the full commit history of the PR for hardcoded secrets, API keys, tokens, and credentials. Findings posted as PR annotations |

To suppress a false positive, add a `# gitleaks:allow` inline comment or add a rule to `.gitleaks.toml` at the repo root.

---

## Deploy Workflow

### `merge-deploy.yml` — Deploy to Dev
**Triggers:** push to `main` (i.e. after PR merge).

Runs against the `dev` GitHub Environment. If **Required reviewers** are configured on that environment (Settings → Environments → dev → Protection rules), a manual approval is required before the deploy proceeds.

| Step | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| Terraform apply | Plans and applies all infrastructure changes to AWS |
| Frontend build | Builds the Vite app with production environment variables |
| S3 sync | Uploads the built frontend to the CloudFront origin S3 bucket |
| CloudFront invalidation | Clears the CDN cache so users see the new version immediately |

---

## Dependency Updates

Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) opens weekly PRs to bump outdated dependencies:

| Ecosystem | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| `pip` | `requirements-dev.txt` |
| `npm` | `frontend/web/package.json` |
| `github-actions` | All workflow `uses:` references |

Minor and patch bumps are grouped into a single PR per ecosystem to reduce noise. Major version bumps get individual PRs.

---

## Security Findings

`bandit` (Python SAST) and `checkov` (IaC security) findings are printed directly in the CI log — visible in the **Actions** tab on any failing run.

> **Note:** GitHub Code Scanning (SARIF upload) requires GitHub Advanced Security, which is only available for public repos or organisations on the GitHub Enterprise plan. SARIF upload steps have been removed from these workflows.

Gitleaks findings appear as PR check annotations.
